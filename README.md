# Snake_Terminal_Game
A Python game built to keep my skills sharp. This should be a beginner-intermediate project.

## Game Instructions

1. **Objective**: The goal of the game is to control the snake, eat the food, and grow longer without hitting the walls or colliding with the snakeâ€™s own body.
   
2. **How to Play**:
   - Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snake's direction:
     - `Up Arrow`: Move up
     - `Down Arrow`: Move down
     - `Left Arrow`: Move left
     - `Right Arrow`: Move right
   - Each time the snake eats the food, it will grow longer and you score a point.
   - The game ends if the snake collides with the wall or its own body.
   
3. **Game Over**:
   - Once the snake collides with the wall or itself, the game will display a "Game Over" message, and you will have the option to restart.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Snake_Terminal_Game.git
cd Snake_Terminal_Game


python snake_game.py
